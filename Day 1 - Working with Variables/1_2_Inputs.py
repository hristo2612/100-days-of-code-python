# Working with Inputs in Python

name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello " + name + "!")

# Here we use len() to get the length of the string of the name variable
# We then convert the int to a string so we can concatenate it with the other strings
print("Your name is " + str(len(name)) + " characters long.")
